# Item Set Calendar

This Omeka S module allows to browse the items of an item set in a calendar
view.

## How to use

- In module's configuration, select item sets you want to be displayed as calendars
- In those item sets items, make sure you have a date in dcterms:date. The date
  can be formatted as "YYYY", "YYYY-MM" or "YYYY-MM-DD".

Now, on the item set page in your public sites, instead of the list of items
you should see a list of years. Click on a year to see a calendar view for that
year.
